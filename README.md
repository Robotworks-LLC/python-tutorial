# Python programming tutorial

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring.

## List of contents

The tutorial consists of two sections:

### Basics

This section will get you started with using Python and you'll be able
to learn more about whatever you want after studying it.

1. [Getting started with Python](basics/getting-started.md)
2. [ThinkPython: The way of the program](basics/the-way-of-the-program.md)
3. [Variables, Booleans and None](basics/variables.md)
4. [Using functions](basics/using-functions.md)
5. [Setting up an editor](basics/editor-setup.md)
6. [If, else and elif](basics/if.md)
7. [Handy stuff with strings](basics/handy-stuff-strings.md)
8. [Lists and tuples](basics/lists-and-tuples.md)
9. [Loops](basics/loops.md)
10. [Trey Hunner: zip and enumerate](basics/trey-hunner-zip-and-enumerate.md)
11. [Dictionaries](basics/dicts.md)
12. [Defining functions](basics/defining-functions.md)
13. [Writing a larger program](basics/larger-program.md)
14. [What is true?](basics/what-is-true.md)
15. [Files](basics/files.md)
16. [Modules](basics/modules.md)
17. [Exceptions](basics/exceptions.md)
28. [Classes](basics/classes.md)
19. [Docstrings](basics/docstrings.md)

### Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experiment with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

1. [Handy data types](advanced/datatypes.md)
2. [Advanced stuff with functions](advanced/functions.md)
3. [Magic methods](advanced/magicmethods.md)
4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](advanced/iters.md)
